title: bake - a make-like utility

For the course [Programming Language Design](http://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndab16008u) I implemented a simple make-like domain specific language.

## Introducing [`bake`](https://github.com/christiankjaer/bake)

You can define constants to be used later. All definitions are written using an arrow (`<-`)
```
@cc <- gcc
@cflags <- -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -O2
```
You can define rules to be used when you have repeating patterns in your scripts
```
@compileLib(in, out)
  @cc -c -o @out @in @cflags
```
`bake` is indentation sensitive just like Python or Haskell. Finally you can define build rules for particular files
```
libs: math.o list.o libs.zip <- math.c list.c
  @compileLib(math.c, math.o)
  @compileLib(list.c, list.o)
  zip src.zip @input
```
`@input` is bound to the input files and `@output` is bound to the output files. To reduce repetition there is also the fish operator (`<-<`). This repeats the rule for every file in the argument list. The previous rule can then be written as
```
libs: math.o list.o <-< math.c list.c
  @compileLib(@input, @output)
```

`bake` does automatic dependency resolution and makes sure that all necessary files are present before executing any commands.

## Implementation
`bake` is implemented in Haskell using [megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec) and the very nice [graph library](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.10.1/docs/Data-Graph.html) by King and Launchbury. 

It uses simple graph algorithms to do dependency resolution and execute the rules in the correct order.
