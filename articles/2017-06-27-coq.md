title: SOAC's in Coq

I just recently completed by bachelors degree at DIKU, and my final project was about formalizing second-order array combinators using the Coq proof assistant.

## Second-order array combinators

SOAC's are limited versions of higher order functions on lists/arrays found in functional programmings languages like Haskell or ML.

In the case of `map` we limit disallow arbitrary function objects, and only allow syntactic lambda abstactions of the form
```
map (\x -> e) xs
```
To optimize programs written using these combinators, we have various fusion rules, for instance for `map`,
```
map g (map f xs) = map (g o f) xs
```
and for `filter`,
```
filter p (filter q xs) = filter (\x -> q && p) xs
```

## The project

The work consisted of verifying these fusion rules by using various methods. The main idea was to formalize a simple programming language, and then verify that these transformations preserved the program semantics for all possible programs.

The formalization can be found [here](https://github.com/christiankjaer/soac-coq). All the details can be foun in the report [here](/files/bachelor.pdf).
